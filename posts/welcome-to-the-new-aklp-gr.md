# Welcome to the new AKLP.gr

I'd like to welcome you to the refreshed AKLP.gr. In the past this domain name was used for a few other blogs of mine, one being the tech news blog and the other was a bit of a collection of guides and tips for linux distros.
From now on, I will be using it to publish stuff that's related to Web Development. I'm not sure what yet but I guess we will find out soon enough!

Here's to a new start!
